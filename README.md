1. I still have to host the project (initially I've used Jumpstarter and have to migrate now)
2. For some reason css style doesn't work yet (I've used separate .css file for styling as suggested),
   so it can look nicer, I'll polish it later
3. Generated password  contains spaces, I've tried trim func and str_replace func to get rid of spaces - but no luck,
   I'll continue looking into this issue
4. For my words input I've used "common English words" from http://www.world-english.org/english500.htm,
   I've manually scraped it, got rid of the words with less than 2 characters and saved in commonWords.txt file
